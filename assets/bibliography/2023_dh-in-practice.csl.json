  {"id":"AlfaifiAtwell2016ComparativeEvaluationTools","abstract":"As the number of Arabic corpora is constantly increasing, there is an obvious and growing need for concordancing software for corpus search and analysis that supports as many features as possible of the Arabic language, and provides users with a greater number of functions. This paper evaluates six existing corpus search and analysis tools based on eight criteria which seem to be the most essential for searching and analysing Arabic corpora, such as displaying Arabic text in its right-to-left direction, normalising diacritics and Hamza, and providing an Arabic user interface. The results of the evaluation revealed that three tools: Khawas, Sketch Engine, and aConCorde, have met most of the evaluation criteria and achieved the highest benchmark scores. The paper concluded that developers’ conscious consideration of the linguistic features of Arabic when designing these three tools was the most significant factor behind their superiority.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Alfaifi","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"Atwell","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"AlfaifiAtwell2016ComparativeEvaluationTools","container-title":"International Journal of Speech Technology","container-title-short":"Int J Speech Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s10772-015-9285-5","ISSN":"1572-8110","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"347-357","source":"Springer Link","title":"Comparative evaluation of tools for Arabic corpora search and analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10772-015-9285-5","volume":"19"},

In addition, this paper proposes a standard protocol with a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of Arabic optical character recognition (OCR) systems to assist researchers in comparing different Arabic OCR approaches. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes an experiment to automatically evaluate four well-known Arabic OCR systems using a set of performance metrics. The evaluation experiment is conducted on a publicly available printed Arabic dataset comprising 240 text images with a variety of resolution levels, font types, font styles and font sizes. Findings The experimental results show that the field of character recognition for printed Arabic still requires further research to reach an efficient text recognition method for Arabic script. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that provides a comprehensive automated evaluation of Arabic OCR systems with respect to the characteristics of Arabic script and, in addition, proposes an evaluation methodology that can be used as a benchmark by researchers and therefore will contribute significantly to the enhancement of the field of Arabic script recognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Mansoor"},{"family":"Teahan","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic","container-title":"PSU Research Review","DOI":"10/gh4457","ISSN":"2399-1747","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210902092554/https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026/full/html","number":"3","page":"229-241","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Experimental evaluation of Arabic OCR systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"DuganMontpellier2021MultipleScripts","abstract":"This paper outlines our methodology for regularizing the transliteration of Urdu-based discourse in digital spaces for analysis with various DH methods. Scholars, acknowledging social media as an increasingly central discursive space and the irregularity of Urdu-based online transliterations, have taken generative steps in this regard (Irvine and Ann 2012, Sharf and Ur Rahman 2017). At the same time, these methods require substantial technical knowledge and do not account for English words or Arabic-based Islamic expressions (e.g. ما شاء الله) and their variants (e.g. mashAllah, ma sha’ Allah, mash’Allah, mA, etc.). This paper advocates the use of spreadsheet applications as an accessible and adaptable tool for regularizing variability in language, script, and orthographic practices in Urdu-based social media discourse. Drawing from challenges faced in our respective research projects, we focus on a small set of piously affective terms and phrases that highlight the applicability of this work for DH projects in Muslim digital worlds. The paper argues that shortening the technical learning curve improves the robustness of DH work with RTL languages, particularly in social media spaces. We elaborate how regularizing orthographic variability in the digital culture in Islamic South Asia and its diasporas widens the analytical scope for scholars working with multiscript, polylingual, and religiously-inflected datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Dugan","given":"Max"},{"family":"Montpellier","given":"Elliot"}],"citation-key":"DuganMontpellier2021MultipleScripts","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Multiple Scripts: Regularizing Social Media Discourse in Urdu and its (Many) Transliterations","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

  {"id":"FarziKianian2019KatibehPersianNews","abstract":"Nowadays, text summarization is one of the most important active research fields in information retrieval. The most of the supervised extractive summarization systems utilize learning-to-rank methods to score sentences according to their importance. They need a high-quality comprehensive summarization corpus, which is labeled manually by human experts. Unfortunately, this sort of corpus is not available for most low-resource languages such as Persian. In this study, first of all, a comprehensive human-labeled summarization corpus (called Bistoon) collected by the crowdsourcing approach is introduced, and then a Persian summarizer based on a novel semi-supervised summarization approach, which is a combination of co-training and self-training, is presented to overcome the absence of sufficient data. During an iterative process, the proposed system is learned by Bistoon corpus and applied to unlabeled texts to generate the most confident summaries. These summaries are added to Bistoon for more iterations. During iterations, the training corpus is grown and the quality of the summarizer is simultaneously improved. The proposed system has been compared to other well-known Persian summarizers over the Pasokh and Bistoon standard test data sets. The evaluation results show the superiority of our methods in terms of precision, F-measure, Rouge metrics, and also human judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Farzi","given":"Saeed"},{"family":"Kianian","given":"Sahar"}],"citation-key":"FarziKianian2019KatibehPersianNews","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","container-title-short":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqy034","ISSN":"2055-7671","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"page":"277-289","source":"Silverchair","title":"Katibeh: A Persian news summarizer using the novel semi-supervised approach","title-short":"Katibeh","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy034","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"MiyagawaEtAl2019OpticalCharacterRecognition","abstract":"Digital Humanities (DH) within Coptic Studies, an emerging field of development, will be much aided by the digitization of large quantities of typeset Coptic texts. Until recently, the only Optical Character Recognition (OCR) analysis of printed Coptic texts had been executed by Moheb S. Mekhaiel, who used the Tesseract program to create a text model for liturgical books in the Bohairic dialect of Coptic. However, this model is not suitable for the many scholarly editions of texts in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic which use noticeably different fonts. In the current study, DH and Coptological projects based in Göttingen, Germany, collaborated to develop a new Coptic OCR pipeline suitable for use with all Coptic dialects. The objective of the study was to generate a model which can facilitate digital Coptic Studies and produce Coptic corpora from existing printed texts. First, we compared the two available OCR programs that can recognize Coptic: Tesseract and Ocropy. The results indicated that the neural network model, i.e. Ocropy, performed better at recognizing the letters with supralinear strokes that characterize the published Sahidic texts. After training Ocropy for Coptic using artificial neural networks, the team achieved an accuracy rate of &gt;91% for the OCR analysis of Coptic typeset. We subsequently compared the efficiency of Ocropy to that of manual transcribing and concluded that the use of Ocropy to extract Coptic from digital images of printed texts is highly beneficial to Coptic DH.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Miyagawa","given":"So"},{"family":"Bulert","given":"Kirill"},{"family":"Büchler","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Behlmer","given":"Heike"}],"citation-key":"MiyagawaEtAl2019OpticalCharacterRecognition","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","container-title-short":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqz023","ISSN":"2055-7671","issue":"Supplement_1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"page":"i135-i141","source":"Silverchair","title":"Optical character recognition of typeset Coptic text with neural networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqz023","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"Nemeth+2013","abstract":"# author's abstract<br>This thesis investigates the evolution of Arabic type-making under the influence of changing technologies. Its historical scope is limited by two events which marked significant turning points in technological development: in 1908 the first adaptation of Arabic to mechanical typesetting equipment heralded the beginning of machine-aided composition; and in 1993 the wide-spread adoption of the Unicode encoding standard marked the end of equipment (platform) dependency for type. Drawing on original archival research, this study mainly analyses primary sources to establish the principal factors that influenced decision making in the design process. It thus aims to contribute to the closing of substantial gaps in existing literature, often marked by fragmentary, unsubstantiated or erroneous information. The thesis outlines the characteristics of changing manufacturing processes and composition equipment, highlighting the impact that technical constraints of machinery conceived for the Latin script had on Arabic type. Moreover, the relative importance of technological constraints and economic pressure, as well as cultural and artistic considerations, are critically assessed through select case studies, chosen for their significance and influence on type-making. The study also briefly discusses the collaboration of Western companies with their customers and representatives in the Arabic script world, and in passing it contextualises typographic,developments in the larger socio-economic settings of the region. In conclusion, historically influential trends and themes developed throughout the thesis are summarised in a concise discussion of the changing approaches to Arabic type-making. Additionally, these approaches are evaluated in order to delineate characteristics of best practice for current practitioners and students. The thesis is intended to be informative for type, printing and design historians, and scholars from a range of related disciplines.","author":[{"family":"Nemeth","given":"Titus"}],"citation-key":"Nemeth+2013","genre":"PhD Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"note":"uuid: FD30FE38-46C8-44FA-AFBB-89770AAFFD53","publisher":"University of Reading","title":"Arabic type-making in the machine age: the influence of technology on the form of Arabic type, 1908-1993","title-short":"Arabic type-making in the machine age","type":"thesis"},

The Enlightenment Architectures project is analysing Sloane’s original manuscript catalogues of his collections to understand their highly complex information architecture and intellectual legacies. In this article we explore some of the challenges of seeking to integrate the methods of digital humanities with those of cataloguing, inventory, curatorial and historical studies and of bringing such interdisciplinary approaches to bear on early modern documentary sources.

The calligraphic Arabic script is extremely flexible, making its text representation economic. However, in physical signs, calligraphy is replaced by Arabic typography, whose type choices may not capture the full flexibility of the Arabic script. Additionally, the graphic logic of dual language sign systems is not as straightforward when applied in Arabic, since the Arabic reads in two directions: right to left for the script and left to right for the numerals.

The proposed system handles the issues of Romanized or abbreviated text and spelling variations in the text to perform the sentiment analysis. The training data set of 3,000 movie reviews and tweets has been manually labeled by native speakers of Hindi in three classes, i.e. positive, negative, and neutral. The system uses WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) tool to convert these string data into numerical matrices and applies three machine learning techniques, i.e. Naive Bayes (NB), J48, and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed system has been tested on 100 movie reviews and tweets, and it has been observed that SVM has performed best in comparison to other classifiers, and it has an accuracy of 68% for movie reviews and 82% in case of tweets. The results of the proposed system are very promising and can be used in emerging applications like SA of product reviews and social media analysis.

  {"id":"Singh+2018+TheMachineIn","abstract":"The decades of 1930s and 40s in which India’s struggle against British rule gained momentum also ushered in critical technological change in the way texts in many Indian languages were materially produced and represented in print. The foremost facilitators of this change were third parties precariously placed in the colonial equation. Focusing on the dilemmas and contradictions of one such concern, the New York-based Mergenthaler Linotype Company and its program for the Devanagari script, this essay examines the mechanics of the power struggle embodied in the process of technological and typographical change. Against the backdrop of India’s independence movement, in deeply contested territories of language and script, the examination of typographical networks that formulated and realized this project throws new light on the richly ambivalent ideological negotiations involved – between popular and academic aspirations, altruistic and commercial enterprises, communal agendas and nationalist politics, and between imperial administration and colonial subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Vaibhav"}],"citation-key":"Singh+2018+TheMachineIn","container-title":"Philological Encounters","DOI":"10.1163/24519197-12340051","ISSN":"2451-9197","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"469-495","publisher":"Brill; https://web.archive.org/web/20211013183408/http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/75684/","source":"centaur.reading.ac.uk","title":"The machine in the colony: technology, politics, and the typography of Devanagari in the early years of mechanization","title-short":"The machine in the colony","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/75684/","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"TaghiZadehEtAl2017NewHybridStemming","abstract":"One of the important issues in natural language processing and information retrieval is the automatic extraction of the word’s stem. Both statistical and rule-based approaches for stemming have their own advantages and limitations. The statistical stemmers are not accurate and fail to take advantage of some language phenomenon which can be easily expressed by simple rules. On the other hand, handcrafting the stemming rules in the rule-based stemmers is a time-consuming, tedious, and impractical task. In this regard, we propose a new hybrid stemming method based on a combination of affix stripping and statistical techniques for Persian language. The proposed method combines cues from the orthography, word frequency, and syntactic distributions to induce the stemming rules. In general, the proposed method is divided into two main parts. In the first part, all words of the annotated text corpus are used to automatically induce the stemming rules; while in the second part, the rule-based stemmer uses the induced stemming rules to discover the word's stem. We test the performance of the proposed scheme on two different data sets. The encouraging results indicate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with its counterparts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Taghi-Zadeh","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Sadreddini","given":"Mohammad Hadi"},{"family":"Diyanati","given":"Mohammad Hasan"},{"family":"Rasekh","given":"Amir Hossein"}],"citation-key":"TaghiZadehEtAl2017NewHybridStemming","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","container-title-short":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqv053","ISSN":"2055-7671","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,1]]},"note":"date_read: 2023-01-30","page":"209-221","title":"A new hybrid stemming method for persian language","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqv053","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"TEIP5Guidelines400","abstract":"TEI P5 version 4.0.0 Release 4.0.0 is codenamed ‘Galileo’ in honor of Galileo's arrival to Rome on 13 February 1633 to face the Inquisition. We associate Galileo with decentering the earth in official western dogma of the universe. Similarly, the stand-off model in this release of the TEI Guidelines may serve to decenter our models of digital texts and expand our frames of reference. With the addition of standOff, a significant change in how characters outside of Unicode are described, and the ability of TEI to self-nest, this version is significantly different than previous versions, and thus deserves an increase in the “major” release number. In addition to the stand-off model, this release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 4.0.0 milestone. The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release:  The standOff element functions as a container element for linked data, contextual information, and stand-off annotations embedded in a TEI document (#374, thanks to Laurent Romary and Piotr Bański). With the introduction of the standOff element a new structural class model.describedResource has been introduced, and model.resourceLike has been revised and renamed model.resource. As the TEI element is a member of the new model.describedResource class, it can now be a child of another TEI element. The new standOff element:  is a child of TEI (or teiCorpus); may contain stand-off annotations, for example morphosyntactic annotations encoded with spanGrp or annotationBlock; may contain stand-off markup, for example a series of certainty, linkGrp, or alt elements; may contain contextual information, for example listPerson and listPlace; may contain information that must be pointed to from elsewhere, but is not found in the source document, for example a castList that represents characters who speak in a drama, but whose roles are not listed in the source document's printed cast list. New elements, attributes, and an attribute class have been introduced for using Unihan properties in TEI (#1805, thanks to Duncan Paterson):  The attribute class att.gaijiProp provides attributes for defining the properties of non-standard characters or glyphs.  The name attribute provides the name of the character or glyph property being defined. The value attribute provides the value of the character or glyph property being defined. The version attribute specifies the version number of the Unicode Standard in which this property name is defined. A list of suggested values is provided. The localProp element provides a locally defined character (or glyph) property. The unicodeProp element provides a Unicode property for a character (or glyph). The unihanProp element holds the name and value of a normative or informative Unihan character (or glyph) property as part of its attributes. A list of legal values from the Unicode Han Database is provided for the name attribute on unihanProp. The use of the elements charProp, charName, localName, unicodeName, and value has been deprecated. Changes were made to improve the precision of language in the Guidelines referring to conformance (#1588) Multiple Schematron rules, assertions, or reports in a single constraintSpec are now correctly output as a single sch:pattern in the RELAX NG schemas (#1625). The discussion of validation has been updated in A Gentle Introduction to XML (#1708). The attributes mode and ident have been added to the remarks element (#1713). The elements decoNote, explicit, and incipit are now members of the model.biblPart class (#1784). The description of the points attribute in att.coordinated has been clarified (#1789). The xr element is now a member of the attribute class att.typed (#1810). Our use of the Travis continuous integration server has been migrated from travis.org to travis.com (#1826). An example to specify the source of a translation has been added (#1830). The description of manuscript descriptions clarifies that msDesc can be used for all text-bearing objects (#1835). The content model of repository, institution, and collection has been changed from macro.xtext to macro.phraseSeq.limited (#1836). The g element is now available within the zone element (#1838). The placeName element has been added to the class model.settingPart and the example in the setting element has been changed accordingly (#1842). The dateline element is now a member of the class model.pLike.front (#1843). The catDesc element is now a member of the attribute class att.canonical (#1864). A Schematron rule has been added to only allow one remarks element per language in specification files (#1872). The datatype of the name attribute of the attRef element has been changed from teidata.text to teidata.name (#1878). The schema has been tightened to prevent a combination of valList in sequence with other members of model.contentPart (#1862). With the addition of the subtype attribute to the attribute class att.textCritical, subtype is now available on lem, rdg, and rdgGrp (#1867). The content model of teiCorpus has been changed (#1922). The constraints for teidata.word have been loosened to allow any character except Unicode separators or control characters (#1930). The explanation of Relax NG and XPath, together with its associated graphic in the chapter A Gentle Introduction to XML have been revised (#1949). Corrections of typographic errors and broken links, improvements on explanations, and corrections of examples have been conducted in various sections of the Guidelines (including #1760, #1847, #1887, #1907, #1909, #1927, #1936, #1948, #1952, #1954, #1964, #1965, #1968, #1969). Furthermore, a number of translations have been added or updated. In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and OxGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 7.49.0 milestone. Highlights of this release include:  The type attribute on biblScope has been replaced by the unit attribute in the tests (#213). Orphaned files in the test directory have been removed (#216). Relative paths to CSS files in the EPUB transformation have been replaced with absolute paths (#312). The jquery library has been updated (#359). Special characters encoded as <w:sym> in DOCX are now converted to hi elements (#389). Correct handling of Schematron rules in attDef elements (#403 and #1950). Finally, we have made some significant updates to our documentation and the website:  Documentation of Council practices in TCW 20 is improved for working with branches in the TEIC GitHub repository #1825. The documentation for updating the TEI Framework in oXygen to the latest release of the TEI Guidelines has been improved #1673 and added to the oxygen-tei repository, see How to automatically update your TEI framework in oXygen. Corrections have been conducted in various sections of the TEI website (including #1944), and #1938.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,7]]},"author":[{"literal":"TEI Consortium"}],"citation-key":"TEIP5Guidelines400","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.3413524","genre":"XML","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,13]]},"publisher":"Zenodo","source":"Zenodo","title":"TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange","title-short":"TEI P5","type":"software","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/3667251","version":"4.0.0"},

AsoSoft text corpus is of size 188 million tokens and has been collected mostly from Web sites, published books, and magazines. The corpus has been normalized and converted into Text Encoding Initiative XML format. In both collecting and processing the text, we have faced several challenges and have proposed solutions to them. About 22% of the corpus is topic annotated with six topic tags, and a topic identification task has been done to evaluate the correctness of annotation. The computational experiments of the Central Kurdish text processing are also presented with the support of related supplementary statistics.

  {"id":"WilsonBlack2022CreatingSpecializedCorpora","abstract":"The availability of large digital archives of historical newspaper content has transformed the historical sciences. However, the scale of these archives can limit the direct application of advanced text processing methods. Even if it is computationally feasible to apply sophisticated language processing to an entire digital archive, if the material of interest is a small fraction of the archive, the results are unlikely to be useful. Methods for generating smaller specialized corpora from large archives are required to solve this problem. This article presents such a method for historical newspaper archives digitized using the METS/ALTO XML standard (Veridian Software, n.d.). The method is an ‘iterative bootstrapping’ approach in which candidate corpora are evaluated using text mining techniques, items are manually labelled, and Naïve Bayes text classifiers are trained and applied in order to produce new candidate corpora. The method is illustrated by a case study that investigates philosophical content, broadly construed, in pre-1900 English-language New Zealand newspapers.
