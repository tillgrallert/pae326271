  {"id":"Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic","abstract":"Purpose The aim of this paper is to experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art printed Arabic text recognition systems to determine open areas for future improvements. In addition, this paper proposes a standard protocol with a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of Arabic optical character recognition (OCR) systems to assist researchers in comparing different Arabic OCR approaches. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes an experiment to automatically evaluate four well-known Arabic OCR systems using a set of performance metrics. The evaluation experiment is conducted on a publicly available printed Arabic dataset comprising 240 text images with a variety of resolution levels, font types, font styles and font sizes. Findings The experimental results show that the field of character recognition for printed Arabic still requires further research to reach an efficient text recognition method for Arabic script. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that provides a comprehensive automated evaluation of Arabic OCR systems with respect to the characteristics of Arabic script and, in addition, proposes an evaluation methodology that can be used as a benchmark by researchers and therefore will contribute significantly to the enhancement of the field of Arabic script recognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Mansoor"},{"family":"Teahan","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic","container-title":"PSU Research Review","DOI":"10/gh4457","ISSN":"2399-1747","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210902092554/https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026/full/html","number":"3","page":"229-241","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Experimental evaluation of Arabic OCR systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"KirmizialtinWrisley2022AutomatedTranscription","abstract":"Our study utilizes deep learning methods for the automated transcription of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century periodicals written in Arabic script Ottoman Turkish (OT) using the Transkribus platform. We discuss the historical situation of OT text collections and how they were excluded for the most part from the late twentieth century corpora digitization that took place in many Latin script languages. This exclusion has two basic reasons: the technical challenges of OCR for Arabic script languages, and the rapid abandonment of that very script in the Turkish historical context. In the specific case of OT, opening periodical collections to digital tools require training HTR models to generate transcriptions in the Latin writing system of contemporary readers of Turkish, and not, as some may expect, in right-to-left Arabic script text. In the paper we discuss the challenges of training such models where one-to-one correspondence between the writing systems do not exist, and we report results based on our HTR experiments with two OT periodicals from the early twentieth century. Finally, we reflect on potential domain bias of HTR models in historical languages exhibiting spatio-temporal variance as well as the significance of working between writing systems for language communities that have experienced language reform and script change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirmizialtin","given":"Suphan"},{"family":"Wrisley","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"KirmizialtinWrisley2022AutomatedTranscription","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Automated Transcription of Non-Latin Script Periodicals: A Case Study in the Ottoman Turkish Print Archive","title-short":"Automated Transcription","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000577/000577.html","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Singh+2018+TheMachineIn","abstract":"The decades of 1930s and 40s in which India’s struggle against British rule gained momentum also ushered in critical technological change in the way texts in many Indian languages were materially produced and represented in print. The foremost facilitators of this change were third parties precariously placed in the colonial equation. Focusing on the dilemmas and contradictions of one such concern, the New York-based Mergenthaler Linotype Company and its program for the Devanagari script, this essay examines the mechanics of the power struggle embodied in the process of technological and typographical change. Against the backdrop of India’s independence movement, in deeply contested territories of language and script, the examination of typographical networks that formulated and realized this project throws new light on the richly ambivalent ideological negotiations involved – between popular and academic aspirations, altruistic and commercial enterprises, communal agendas and nationalist politics, and between imperial administration and colonial subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Vaibhav"}],"citation-key":"Singh+2018+TheMachineIn","container-title":"Philological Encounters","DOI":"10.1163/24519197-12340051","ISSN":"2451-9197","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"469-495","publisher":"Brill; https://web.archive.org/web/20211013183408/http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/75684/","source":"centaur.reading.ac.uk","title":"The machine in the colony: technology, politics, and the typography of Devanagari in the early years of mechanization","title-short":"The machine in the colony","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/75684/","volume":"3"}
