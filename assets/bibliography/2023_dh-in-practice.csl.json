  {"id":"Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic","abstract":"Purpose The aim of this paper is to experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art printed Arabic text recognition systems to determine open areas for future improvements. In addition, this paper proposes a standard protocol with a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of Arabic optical character recognition (OCR) systems to assist researchers in comparing different Arabic OCR approaches. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes an experiment to automatically evaluate four well-known Arabic OCR systems using a set of performance metrics. The evaluation experiment is conducted on a publicly available printed Arabic dataset comprising 240 text images with a variety of resolution levels, font types, font styles and font sizes. Findings The experimental results show that the field of character recognition for printed Arabic still requires further research to reach an efficient text recognition method for Arabic script. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that provides a comprehensive automated evaluation of Arabic OCR systems with respect to the characteristics of Arabic script and, in addition, proposes an evaluation methodology that can be used as a benchmark by researchers and therefore will contribute significantly to the enhancement of the field of Arabic script recognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Mansoor"},{"family":"Teahan","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic","container-title":"PSU Research Review","DOI":"10/gh4457","ISSN":"2399-1747","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210902092554/https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026/full/html","number":"3","page":"229-241","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Experimental evaluation of Arabic OCR systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026","volume":"1"},
