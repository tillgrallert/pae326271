## Introduction

In 2015, I had just finished my PhD on the history of the street in late Ottoman Damascus (1875--1914) and moved to Beirut for a new post-doctoral research project on the genealogy of food riots across the predominantly Arabic-speaking Eastern Mediterranean from the nineteenth century to the present [@Grallert+2019]. 
The main source for both projects were periodicals---tens of thousands of newspaper and magazine articles published in Arabic and Ottoman Turkish across the region. But despite their quotidian nature, their pivotal role for central cultural phenomena of the time as the region's first mass medium, and ubiquitous references in scholarly literature, surprisingly little of substance is known about this medium in terms of individual publication histories, distribution channels, and audiences or the number and whereabouts of surviving copies. This is particularly true for periodicals published outside the centers of the press in Beirut and Cairo.[^cf1]

The sheer size of the corpus and the focus on social history suggested I muster help of computational tools and networked infrastructures to keep track of the events and developments I was interested in. Working with textual material in Arabic---one of the six official working languages of the United Nations but also a severely under-resourced language in the digital realm---and in a region with severely limited access to utilities {--to reliable electricity and internet connections--} forced me to learn more about the nitty-gritty details of the multidimensional infrastructural underpinnings of modern scholarship than I ever wanted. 

In spring 2015, I was part of the first Digital Humanities Institute -- Beirut, organised by David Wrisley and Randa el Khatib, where I taught a course on [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} with a focus on local, Arabic-speaking material. I also met Alex Gil, who introduced me to the idea of [*minimal computing*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}

The two projects featured in this essay, [Jarāʾid][jaraid] and "Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE)"[^fn1], were born out of a two-fold need and with a simple idea: Creatively repurpose {--and process --}existing open data, tools, and infrastructures in order to provide sustainable public and free access to reliable knowledge about periodicals as well as high-quality digital editions and to do so not just in Latinized transcriptions as is established scholarly practice in the Global North but in their original script and languages.



This essay is structured in two sections. The first section is concerned with creating the necessary knowledge about the history of the Arabic periodical press, its material artefacts, and existing digital remediations. It introduces catalogues as historical documents and the consequences of hegemonic monolingual technological infrastructures of the Global North for creating and recording {--(and consequently sharing)--} knowledge about cultural artefacts and practices of societies in the Global South. Here, I use Arabic as a prime example how character encodings, rendering engines, and a complete lack of interest from market-dominating software vendors and platforms exercise epistemic violence [@Fiormonte2021Taxation].

## Creating knowledge about artefacts or gathering and recording data about data

The first need, therefore, was (and still is) a need for improving our knowledge about periodicals as the embodiment of socio-economic relations, intellectual traditions, and political frameworks, their manifestation in a limited number of material artefacts, the transmission of individual artefacts into private and public collections, and finally their occasional digital remediation. I would need to know which paper was published and potentially covered the series of food riots across cities of the Syrian hinterland, such as Hama and Homs in summer 1910 [C.f. @Grallert+2019]. I would then need to know if copies survived the turmoil that since wreaked havoc upon the region and its cultural heritage over the last century, where to find surviving copies, and how to access them.

Despite quotidian impressions to the contrary, many library catalogues have not been digitised or published online. This is particularly true for institutions outside the Global North and collections of material from the Global South. The website of the Lebanese National Library, for instance, still advertises its catalogue as forthcoming. Manually compiled union catalogues are a Herculean task and have largely fallen out of fashion with the advent of COPACs. Given their publication dates and the necessary time for information collection, they should probably be read as historical sources rather than finding aids [E.g. @ElHadi+1965; @Hopwood+1970; @Aman+1979; @DeJong+1979; @Iḥdādan+1984; @Khūrī+1985; @Höpp+1994; @Atabaki+1995]. Likewise, library catalogues are layered historical documents that accumulate traces of their socio-technic affordances with each remediation. Looking at one of the many entries for [ʿAbdallāh Nadīm al-Idrīsī]{.persName custom-style="persName"}'s weekly journal [al-Ustādh]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}, published in Cairo from 1892 to 1893, in Worldcat, we most likely will not encounter a record newly created from the material artefact by an expert cataloguer with domain knowledge in Arabic periodicals and the ability to read Arabic script. Even {--with the necessary domain knowledge--}{++ if++} she will most likely have had to contend with technological systems ill-suited, if not unable, to deal with the metadata in its original script, calendars or naming conventions.

### The representational power of monolingual infrastructures and Latin script

Arabic is {--both--} one of the main human languages with more than 420 million speakers {--and--}{++ as well as++} a writing system for many historic and contemporary Asian and African languages, such as Persian, Urdu, Pashtu, Ottoman, Uzbek or Uighur [@Mumin.Versteegh+2014+TheArabicScript]. The script is written from right to left, most letters connect in the writing direction within a word, and letters have up to four {--shapes--}{++ letterforms++} depending on their position within a string. Multiple letters share the same basic {--shape--}{++ letterform++} ([rasm]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}).  Diacritical signs ([iʿjām]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}), mostly dots below and above the [rasm]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}, allow to decrease semantic ambiguity. Depending on writing style and typefonts, {++multiple letterforms ++}{--letters--} will form ligatures. Letterforms and ligatures will not necessarily sit on a single baseline and baselines can be tilted ([@fig:arabic]). There are only few exceptions to these script-specific writing rules across languages. Importantly for us, the diacritics are not strictly necessary for readers as is evidenced by recent efforts at circumventing surveillance and censorship of authoritarian Arab regimes by using (an approximation of) the [rasm]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} on social media. Furthermore, their use is subject to changing cultural preferences. Some regional practices all but omit them from specific letters, particularly at the end of a word.[^fn2]

Words are underlined in [*red*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}. Ligatures of multiple letters are underlined in [*green*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}.](/Users/Shared/BachUni/publications/github/p0fb41f86/assets/figures/arabic-script_annotated.png){#fig:arabic}

Type-written card-catalogues, hot-metal printing presses, electronic computers (understood as an interdependent combination of hardware and software) form a global hegemonic technology stack bound up in historically contingent cultural traditions of the Global North. Mechanically and, later, electronically recording information in scripts other than Latin---particularly complex scripts with a much larger number of graphemes and different writing directions---was never considered sufficiently important or profitable to be supported out-of-the-box [@Nemeth2018ArabicHotMetal; @Singh+2018+TheMachineIn].
Computational systems {--dealing with textual objects--} not only derive from their type-setting ancestors and enforce Latin script grammar upon other writing systems, t{++hey also inherited the concept of++} national languages and do not consequently distinguish between {--writing systems --}{++scripts++} and languages. The character-encoding standard Unicode enabled vendor-independent exchange and interoperability of texts in Arabic script but it continues to adhere to the script grammar of Latin and the affordances of movable type-printing [c.f. @FiormonteEtAl2015PoliticsOfCode, 3-4].[^fn3] Unicode's organising principle of code points is a confusing combination of scripts and languages that results in multiple code points for the same glyph.
Anybody entering Arabic texts into a computer has to select one specific interpretation, one and only one Unicode representation of a textual string they want to {++encode++}{-- type into the computer--}. They have to either normalise historical or geographic orthographic variance or pick visually-matching but technically "wrong" glyphs.  The resulting large variety of encodings for the same string of Arabic letterforms depends largely on the language of operating systems and keyboard settings on the input device [c.f. @VeisiEtAl2020KurdishLanguageProcessing].
Egyptian cultural preferences, for instance, would virtually always omit the two dots underneath a final [yāʾ]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} (U+064A: [ي]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}). To mirror such cultural preferences, one can either select the Arabic [alif maqṣūra]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} (U+0649: [ى]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}) or the Persian [ye]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} (U+06CC: [ی]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}) [c.f. @TaghiZadehEtAl2017NewHybridStemming]. Unfortunately, search algorithms built into modern operating systems are not aware of these variances and any application software relying on them will return skewed results without additional efforts at regularisation or a reduction to the [rasm]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} [@Milo.Martinez+2019+ANewStrategy].

The necessary human-machine interfaces for interacting with digital information present another layer of inaccessibility for those wanting to engage with Arabic text as encoding and rendering information are two different steps. 

Support for the correct rendering of Arabic with connected letters, from right-to-left, and right-aligned is growing but remains hit-and-miss depending on operating systems and software applications---even on the web. [HTML5]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} is the current standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web maintained as a "living standard" by the [*Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([WHATWG]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}), whose members are the leading vendors of web browsers: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. Developed since the  mid-2000s, [HTML5]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} incorporates many aspects of [XHTML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} and introduced much needed, detailed semantics. Most importantly for our discussion, [HTML5]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} added the global `@lang` attribute, which mirrors the earlier `@xml:lang` attribute and allows to explicitly specify the language of a document or parts thereof through the use of [BCP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} 47 language tags, such as  "ar" for Arabic or "en" for English [@BCP47]. Yet, despite having been originally developed in 2008 and being maintained by an industry consortium of leading browser vendors{-- since 2019--}, no major modern web browser, however, uses the `@lang` attribute in their built-in [CSS]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} for text-alignment or font selection. Even if a website declares its content as being written in Arabic, browsers such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari, do not correctly render the text as right-aligned ([@fig:arabic-fail-chrome]).  The necessary fix requires only a single line of code (`*[lang^="ar"] {direction:rtl;}`)---from everyone publishing text in right-to-left scripts on the Web. The problem is not aesthetics. Trailing punctuation marks become leading punctuation marks without these adjustments (Final line on [@fig:arabic-fail-chrome]).

<!-- ![The beginning of [@oclc_4770057679-i_13-div_8.d1e1249] as rendered in Firefox](https://tillgrallert.github.io/slides/assets/dh/html5-lang_ar-firefox-2.png){#fig:arabic-fail-firefox} -->

This lack of support is not limited to viewing content. Software for editing digital editions marked up in [*Extensible Markup Language*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) following the guidelines of the [*Text*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}
[*Encoding Initiative*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([TEI]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) [@TEIP5Guidelines400]{--, from basic text editors to full-scale XML editors,--} represent the same attitude in their [CSS]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} to render a more human-friendly view of the commonly verbose [XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} files. The developers of the {--extremely--} popular oXygen [XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} editor added the relevant [CSS]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} for rendering [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} in their "author mode" in 2015 (v17, see [@fig:bidi-xml-oxygen-author]) and in response to our feature request. But this support for correctly rendering Arabic and some other rtl languages is limited to [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}.

This leads to another major issue in the insufficient support for Arabic in the digital realm: the display of bi-directional text on a two-dimensional surface, particularly on the same line, which is necessary for editing Arabic content in most standard formats. If we assume writing directions differ only in one dimension, such as left-to-right and right-to-left, but all scripts otherwise follow the same direction in the second dimension, such as top-to-bottom, it is impossible to decide whether both scripts are of equal importance to the text or which one takes precedence over the other. [XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} is fully unicode-compliant and supports tag and attribute names in any script as long as they can be encoded in unicode. Only the [XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} declaration (`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`) at the very beginning of the file needs to be written in Latin script, which, in turn, causes all computational tools to assume that they encounter a document with a left-to-right reading order (that at this point might or might not include bits and pieces in other writing systems) ([@fig:bidi-xml-oxygen]).

Beyond the fundamental impossibility to adequately record written Arabic in digital form{-- without normalisation--}, cultural heritage and practices of societies from the Global South require constant efforts of translation{++ and++}{--,--} transcription{--, and normalisation--}, themselves intrinsically entangled with the socio-technical traditions of the Global North [C.f. @DuganMontpellier2021MultipleScripts]. The aforementioned journal [al-Ustādh]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} is a simple, yet powerful example. "[al-Ustādh]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}" is, of course, a transliteration of the Arabic title
 [الاستاذ]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}
into Latin script, as is the rendering of the publisher's name 
[عبد الله النديم الإدريسي]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}
 as [ʿAbdallah al-Nadīm al-Idrīsī]{.persName custom-style="persName"}. These transcriptions follow the widely adopted system of the [*International Journal of Middle East Studies*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([IJMES]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}). Catalogers in German-speaking countries would follow a system with 1:1 character transliterations devised by the [*Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([DMG]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) and{--, therefore,--} record the title as [al-Ustāḏ]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}. In addition to the output language, transcription schemes differ between input languages in the same script. The British Library's [*Endangered Archives Programme*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([EAP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}), for instance, misread the Ottoman Turkish title
[يكي تصوير افكر]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}
 as 
[تصوير افكر]{.Arabic custom-style="Arabic"}
, assumed it was Arabic (because Ottoman was written in Arabic script until 1924) and "correctly" transcribed it as [Taṣwīr Afkār]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} while the correct transcription of the Ottoman would have been [Yeni]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} [Taṣvīr-i Efkār]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} [@EAP119/1/18_website]. 
Finally, such transcription schemes require diacritics not necessarily available on technical systems and not commonly recognised by the OCR-algorithms used for retro digitisation of card catalogues.

Discovery systems across the board are unsuited for this plurality of scripts and the large variety of transcriptions. All come with idiosyncrasies of their own, such as internally removing or normalising some or all diacritics from search queries. Worse, these choices are rarely documented and communicated to their users. Through ignorance or lack of interest in providing potentially costly services to communities outside the Global North and their cultural heritage, users are commonly left to their own tools and have to try each and every version of a string they can think of (see [@fig:zdb-ar; @fig:zdb-dmg; @fig:zdb-dmg-defective]).

## Creating a crowd-sourced union list

The project ["Jarāʾid: A Chronology of Arabic Periodicals (1800-1929)"][jaraid] has seen many iterations since its inception by Adam Mestyan in the early 2010s [@Mestyan.etal+2020+JaraidAchronology; @Mestyan.Grallert+2012+ProjectJaraid; @Mestyan.Grallert+2020+JaraIdChronology]. At its core, Jarāʾid is a volunteer effort of scholars working with periodicals {--as a source for or subject of their research--} to openly share their collective knowledge about the publication history of Arabic periodical titles and their surviving copies, including digitised artefacts. I have been involved in the project as one of its main contributors and {--technical--} lead on data modelling and some iterations of the website since 2012. Starting from a modest table of a few hundred titles in a Word document, Jarāʾid has grown into a catalogue of more than 3200 Arabic periodicals from all around the globe, recording [*inter alia*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} known titles, editors, publishers, place of publication, dates of first issue, additional publication languages in case of multilingual publications. Rooted in the {--cataloguing and--} scholarly practices described above, information was originally gathered in Latinized transcriptions as found in sources and library catalogues and then normalized into the [IJMES]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} system. In recent years, we have computationally re-transcribed these Latin transcriptions into Arabic script based on heuristic approach of rules and look-up tables. Jarāʾid therefore represents not just the only comprehensive union list of this material but the only one that can be searched and browsed in the original script. 
Finally, I have integrated holding information from [HathiTrust][hathi], the [Zeitschriften Datenbank ([ZDB]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"})][zdb], a database of periodical holdings in German-speaking countries, and the library of the American University of Beirut based on public [API]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}s (former two) and personal collaborations (the latter) [@Grallert2022IntegratingLibraryData].

Jarāʾid is a very modest effort but it has become indispensable to the field despite our failure to attract any funding beyond an initial 500 Euros. Even though the project predates the approach of [[*minimal computing*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}][minimal] as introduced by [@Gil+2016; see also @RisamGil2022Introduction] it resonates with the questions and approaches outlined therein: focus on the things we can do and build the infrastructures we need "without the help we can't get" [@Gil+2016, 29]. Our technical decisions, from data formats to software stacks, result from balancing our scholarly need as a community with the limited knowledge, tools, and infrastructures at our disposal. [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} is certainly not what one would expect for bibliographic metadata but [XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} and related technologies was the only data serialisation format we had experiences with. In addition, the pilot for what later became [[FIHRIST]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}][fihrist] had just {--shown and --}adapted [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} to be a viable format for catalogues of Arabic manuscripts [C.f. @Soualah+2012; @OrtoljaBairdEtAl2019DigitalHumanitiesMemory, 3]. [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} also allowed us to treat bibliographic data as historical source and annotate it with information on the origin of information, certainty of stated facts, dates, and links to external authority files in a semantically rich catalogue without a relational database. The resulting data---mainly [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} files and their derivates---are hosted on [GitHub][github]. Releases are archived in the publicly-funded research data repository [Zenodo][zenodo]. Jarāʾid thus satisfies our goals of [*accessibility*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}, [*sustainability*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}, and [*credibility*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}.


[@fig:map-periodicals-status] shows the distribution of all Arabic periodical titles published across South West Asia and North Africa ([SWANA]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) between 1789 and 1929 based on the [Jarāʾid][jaraid] dataset. [@fig:map-periodicals-holdings] shows the 504 or 15,59% of all 3232 titles in this dataset that could be located in collections. Only 148 or 4,58% of all titles have been at least partially digitised.

## Access to artefacts

The very limited extent of digitisation is at least partially explained by the knowledge gap and interrelated survival and collection biases. Here, we are interested in the meaning of [*digitised*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}. The vast majority of those 148 periodicals is solely available as digital facsimiles due to the challenges Arabic script{--, as outlined above,--} poses to traditional, segmentation-based approaches to computational text recognition. Accuracy rates for leading Arabic [OCR]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} solutions are well below 75% on the character level [@Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic; @Alkhateeb.etal+2017+ArabicOpticalCharacter; cf. @Märgner+2012a; @Habash+2010+IntroductionToArabic], which causes the Internet Archive to state that the "language [is] not currently OCRable" [item description for @KurdAli+1923+GharaibAlGharba]. Commercial vendors frequently make opaque claims of highly accurate text recognition technologies but none share their code or data for evaluation. Their search-centric interfaces return high numbers of false positives. With the extent of false negatives---strings not found even though they are present in the original---impossible to determine, such data layers are nigh impossible to use beyond anecdotal evidence [@Grallert2022DHQ, §13; @Grallert+2020, 64-65]. 

[OCR]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} technologies for non-Latin scripts and ligatures such as Arabic have seen vast improvements with the widespread application of machine-learning approaches---from [Kraken](http://kraken.re/), to [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) and [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)---which generally have shown to reliably produce high levels of accuracy independent of input language and script [@Kiessling+2017].[^cf2] They still suffer, however, from insufficient recognition of layouts and reading orders and the lack of models trained for this specific genre of texts. [^cf3]  Most of the material currently available online has been digitised over the course of the last twenty years and would require renewed effort and substantial funding to apply the latest [OCR]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} technologies.[^cf4] 

[*Digitised*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} should also not be conflated with [*openly accessible*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} on the internet. As Tim Sherrart [-@Sherratt+2019] called on us to query for the meaning of access, one has to ask "access to what and for whom?". Many{++ digitised Arabic periodicals++} are kept in data silos with no application programming interfaces ([API]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}s) or the option to manually download more than individual page images. They are protected from their readers by layers of paywalls, geofencing, and forced personal registration. [al-Muqtabas]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}, for example, is commonly deemed in the public domain by vendors in the United States. Copies from the [University of Minnesota](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100658549){--, [University of Virginia](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/102043258),--} and [Princeton University](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008882293) {--have been scanned by Google and--} are openly available online through HathiTrust---for scholars at member institutions and the general public in the US as determined by a user's [IP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} address. Everyone else will see blank pages or needs access to [VPN]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} services. Automated downloads frequently violate terms of use even if the vendor designates the material as being in the public domain. In one instance, such attempts by an academic resulted in (temporary) blanket block of an her home institution's entire [IP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} range.

In consequence, we witness a neo-colonial absence of the Global South from the digital cultural record [@Risam+2019; c.f. @Gooding+2018, 149-157; @Thylstrup+2018, 79-100]. The shocking differences are probably best illustrated by the comparison between the number of digitised Arabic periodicals and digitised newspapers from the German state of Hesse ([@tbl:digitisation]) [@HessischeRegionalzeitungen2019].

### Open Arabic Periodical Editions, 2015--

Open Arabic Periodical Editions ([OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) is a project to design and implement workflows for sustainable,  scholarly digital editions with the affordances of the Global South. Based on the guiding principles of [*accessibility*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}, [*simplicity*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}, [*sustainability*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}, and [*credibility*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}, [OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} unites openly available digital facsimiles from institutional scanning efforts with human-transcribed text from shadow libraries and models them in [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} as an open, standard-compliant, and well-established format for digital editions. {--with the aim of verifying the latter through the former.--} {--Without any project-specific funding and relying on voluntary work--}{++ ++}[OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} aims at providing a means to verify transcriptions against facsimiles and thus the necessary ground truth for training text recognition algorithms, a reliable corpus for distant reading, and reliably citable digital remediations. {++Despite our extremely limited resources---++}no project funds, no staff {++beyond ++}volunteering interns,{++ ++}and no equipment beyond our own computers{++---++}we have published a corpus of six periodical editions with a total of 41 volumes, 645 issues and more than six million words ([@tbl:corpus]). All files, including bibliographic metadata on the article level in a number of standard formats, are published on [GitHub][openarabicpe_git], which also hosts a static webview for human readers based on the [[TEI]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate][tei_boilerplate]. Releases are archived in the [Zenodo][zenodo] research data repository.[^cf5] Our plan to provide stable access through Canonical Texts Services ([CTS]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) and integration into [CLARIN]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s [*Virtual Language Observatory*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} was abandoned after an initial upload of all issues of [al-Muqtabas]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} because of unsustainable maintenance costs and our editions' evolving character.[^cf6]

Table: [OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s corpus of periodical editions {#tbl:corpus}

[^tb1]: The current cut-off date is 1918.
[^tb2]: Since [Riḍā]{.persName custom-style="persName"}'s [Tafsīr]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}, which accounts for about one fifth of [al-Manār]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}'s content, was not included [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}'s transcription, it is also missing from the digital edition. See @Zemmin+2016 [232].

[[al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}][shamela] (The Comprehensive Library, 2005--, henceforth [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}) is the largest of a number of extremely popular shadow libraries for Arabic texts [@Verkinderen+2020+AlMaktabaAlShamilaShort]. It is widely used but rarely cited by scholars [@Grallert2022DHQ, §30; c.f. @Miller+2018, 104] and has been repeatedly {--evaluated --}{++employed++} for building scholarly corpora with a focus on distant reading approaches to classical texts [@Belinkov+2016; @Alrabiah+2013; @GundelfingerVerkinderen2020Governors; @OpenITIDocumentation]. [OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} was the first project to emphasise the transformation of material from [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} into verified scholarly editions and remains the only one with a modern focus.

We designed and applied workflows to automatically transform [EPub]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} (which is largely a zipped folder of [HTML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}) files from {--[al-Maktaba al-shāmila][shamela] (The Comprehensive Library, 2005--, henceforth--} [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}{--)--} into [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}{-- XML following the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)][tei]'s guidelines [@teiconsortium2020TEIP5Guidelines]--}. 
Part of this step was to extract as much structural mark-up as possible from the [HTML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} source. We modelled each issue as a single [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} file in order to keep the original organisation of texts in this compound medium as they were published. Remediations of the material into other organisational structures for editing or reading purposes are left to future developments and user input. The individual periodical issue also happened to be the only reliable structural information provided by [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}. Individual files provided structural information in various forms, from structural (e.g. `<span class="title">`) to stylistic tags (`<span class="red">`) but only very little proved reliable enough for automatic conversion.
For the journal [al-Muqtabas]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}, for example, [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} somewhat consistently recorded all first-level articles and sections but no news items and articles within sections and no sections within longer articles. Thus, structural information for items in the "News and ideas" section ([akhbār wa afkār]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}), such as  [@oclc_4770057679-i_61-div_21.d1e2838], were not recorded [@fig:muqtabas-6-2-shamela]. The same is true for explicitly authorship information in bylines{-- was not encoded in any way--}. We tried to catch both phenomena in multiple iterations of our conversion processes based on the length of paragraphs (`<p>`) and their position within the surrounding text string: Short paragraphs in predefined sections were assumed to signify the beginning of constituent articles. Short paragraphs at the end of articles were presumably bylines. 

This approach depends on reliable and consistent transcription of paragraphs and we learned that this had not been the case for all journals available from [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}. Consistency and reliability also differed between issues of the same journal, probably indicating different human transcribers and editors. 
Algorithmic searches for uncharacteristically short pages with close reading of these pages {--then--} {--further--} substantiated the hypothesis of human transcribers because most omissions can be plausibly explained by common human errors: {--namely--} skipping a few words on a long line, jumping a small number of lines, or turning two pages at once. This also indicates that [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} had no quality control{-- strategies--} such as double-keying. Finally, we incidentally found  unmarked comments interspersed in the transcription itself, stating, for example, that someone could not read the following four lines in the copy in front of them [@oclc_644997575-i_11-div_4.d1e704, 422]. 
From these notes, common orthographic normalisation, and the omission of all words in Latin script, we can safely deduce that the transcribers were Arabic speakers. We are still looking for ways to adequately acknowledge their work beyond a generic reference in the metadata section of our [TEI/XML]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} files.

![[@oclc_4770057679-i_61-div_21.d1e2838] on [[*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}](http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-26523#page-4046)](https://openarabicpe.github.io/slides/assets/shamela_muqtabas-annotated.png){#fig:muqtabas-6-2-shamela}

![Facsimile of [@oclc_4770057679-i_61-div_21.d1e2838] from [[EAP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}][eap]](http://images.eap.bl.uk/EAP119/EAP119_1_4_5/133.jp2/full/800,/0/gray.jpg){#fig:muqtabas-6-2-133-eap}

Adding and validating structural information required to identify the corresponding digital facsimile or material artefact, which means identifying the page the digital text was transcribed from. Arabic journals and magazines were{--, as far as I have seen, --}organised into annual, numbered volumes and numbered issues corresponding to the their respective publication schedule (monthly, fortnightly, weekly etc.). Unlike newspapers, journals restarted their issue count with every volume. [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}'s transcriptions, on the other hand, abolished volumes as organising principle and count (available) issues in a consecutive sequence (see the sidebar in [@fig:muqtabas-6-2-shamela]).  
Locating the corresponding issue therefore required knowledge about every periodical's actual publication schedule. This could usually only be established by accessing physical copies or digital facsimiles because journals frequently diverted from their official publication schedule by publishing fewer issues per volume.[^cf7]

[*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} human-readable dating information at the beginning of each issue proved largely fictional both in regards to a journal's official publication schedule and individual issues' actual publication dates. 
Our process for generating the necessary bibliographic metadata for linking digital texts to facsimiles was a hybrid one: automatic iteration based on known publication dates and validation against the original.

Digital facsimiles are available from a growing number of vendors. [OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} was largely inspired by the British Library's [*Endangered Archives Programme*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} ([[EAP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}][eap]) publishing the scans of Arabic periodical collections in the al-Aqṣā Mosque's library in Jerusalem ([[EAP119]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}][eap119]) in the early 2010s [^cf8] but has since added links to facsimiles from [HathiTrust][hathi], [Translatio][translatio], and [[Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}][alsharekh], the largest Arabic platform for facsimiles of historical periodicals. With regard to the latter, one must note that proclaimed facsimiles cannot be taken as such [*prima facie*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}. As it turned out, they had rendered the text of an entire volume of [al-Muqtabas]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} from [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} in a original-looking layout and served them as "fakesimiles" [@Grallert2022DHQ, §14]. This further emphasises the need for and value of vetted text and image layers in digital [*scholarly*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} editions, such as the ones produced by [OpenArabicPE]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}. 




Ultimately, locating page breaks in the text stream in order to link them to digital facsimiles proved to be the most labour-intensive task. Recording the original position of page breaks had apparently not been a priority for [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"}'s anonymous transcribers. While some periodicals faithfully followed the original, others did not and introduced their own page breaks. [@fig:muqtabas-6-2-shamela] and [@fig:muqtabas-6-2-133-eap] demonstrate this mismatch. While [*Shamela*]{.EmphasisCustom custom-style="EmphasisCustom"} recorded the page number as 45 ([@fig:muqtabas-6-2-shamela]), digital facsimiles from EAP show the article was published on page 133 ([@fig:muqtabas-6-2-133-eap]). Consequently, every one of the c.8000 page breaks in the journals [[al-Muqtabas]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}][muqtabas_git] and [[al-Ḥaqāʾiq]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"}][haqaiq_git] needed to be manually marked up by volunteers.[^cf9] My gratitude goes to Dimitar Dragnev, Talha Güzel, Dilan Hatun, Hans Magne Jaatun, Xaver Kretzschmar, Daniel Lloyd, Klara Mayer, Tobias Sick, Manzi Tanna-Händel and Layla Youssef, who contributed their time to this task.

On the technical level, linking is trivial, particularly since the increasing adoption of [IIIF]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} infrastructures in [GLAM]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} institutions. Links to externally hosted facsimiles, on the other hand, are the most volatile component of our data layer and we already encountered three major instances of link rot. Two were caused by vendors moving servers and changing protocols: The British Library moved {--the Endangered Archives Programme--}{++ ++}[EAP]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} to [IIIF]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} in 2017 and [Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} moved to a new domain in 2019. {--In another instance,--} HathiTrust, on the other hand, removed the facsimiles of Princeton's copy of [[al-Haqāʾiq]{.Transcription custom-style="Transcription"} 1 (1910)](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101036074001) from the public domain without any explanation in 2016. HathiTrust reinstated public access six years later after multiple inquiries. Such link rot inevitably requires a lot of manual labour to figure out the patterns in new [URL]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"}s (if any) and to write the necessary scripts to update all [TEI]{.Abbreviation custom-style="Abbreviation"} files. {--Derivative formats, such as bibliographic metadata, although part of the data layer and preserved on Zenodo, can easily be regenerated from the main TEI files whenever changes to the infrastructure or updated standards necessitate it.--}
